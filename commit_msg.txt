feat(api): Add RabbitMQ events and MinIO storage integration

Implement an event publisher using RabbitMQ to emit InspeccionCreadaEvent
when a new inspection is created. Add MinIO storage client and
UploadInspeccionFotoUseCase to support photo uploads. Update PostgreSQL
schema and SQLAlchemy models to store foto_keys as an array.

Fixes Hito-2.3
